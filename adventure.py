# Possible modifications:
# - use more succinct commands (l/u/d/r for up/down/left/right or n/s/e/w for north/south/east/west)
# - add boundaries to the map, when the player attempts to move beyond the boundary, stop them or move them to the other side
# - make whatâ€™s printed on the screen a part of a much larger map (with the player always shown at the center of the screen)
# - loading a text file containing the map, or procedurally generate things
# - walls / barriers
# - use different unicode characters (you can find lists online)
# - ascii art
# - colorama for custom colors, or curses for even more control of the terminal
# - add â€˜fog of warâ€™ - only show the elements of board immediately around the player (you can then find a torch item, which expands your visibility)
# - have enemies move around
# - add an inventory system
# - add player health, more complex encounters
# - add hidden treasure, make the objective to find all the treasure
# - add a â€˜final bossâ€™ that you can only face once collecting items
# - re-use previous labs (guess the number, rock-paper-scissors)
